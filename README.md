# Do I Need To Give Credits?

Well. Of Course xd, The only term of use is that you include the following credit in your game:
“The Template Used In This Project Is Made By Project164”

If you use specific assets or code from this project, please credit them like this example:
“Anim Blueprint by Project164”

Please don’t skid my work like others did with my Fortress Recreation project.
I’m doing this for the community — all I ask for is a small mention. Thanks.
